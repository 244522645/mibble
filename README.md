Mibble is an open-source SNMP MIB parser (or SMI parser) written
in Java. The Mibble library contains classes for easy access to all
the information in the MIB file, including OIDs, type data and
descriptions. A couple of useful applications are also bundled with
Mibble, among them a MIB browser with a simple SNMP manager.
