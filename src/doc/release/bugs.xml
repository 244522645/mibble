        <title>Support strict SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 parsing</title>
        <text>When parsing SNMPv1 files, no symbols or constructs
        from SNMPv2 should be available. The opposite goes for SNMPv2
        files. (Bug #4367)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Create unit tests</title>
        <text>All the source code should be tested automatically
        through JUnit or a similar tool. This is a minor issue,
        however, as the complete library is always tested with all
        the IETF MIB files on each build. (Bug #4368)</text>
