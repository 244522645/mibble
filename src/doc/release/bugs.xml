    of version <param name="version" /> (<param name="date" />). The

        <title>Support strict SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 parsing</title>
        <text>When parsing SNMPv1 files, no symbols or constructs
        from SNMPv2 should be available. The opposite goes for SNMPv2
        files. <ref bug="4367" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Create unit tests</title>
        <text>All the source code should be tested automatically
        through JUnit or a similar tool. This is a minor issue,
        however, as the complete library is always tested with all
        the IETF MIB files on each build. <ref bug="4368" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Add SNMP client capabilities</title>
        <text>The Mibble library currently has no support for SNMP
        agents or clients. It might be possible to integrate with the
        WestHawk SNMP stack to provide this. <ref bug="6317" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Validate SEQUENCE element types</title>
        <text>The types in a <code>SEQUENCE</code> should be validated
        against their counterparts if also defined separately.

      <item>
        <title>Add object serialization</title>
        <text>There is currently no easy way to store the state of a
        loaded Mib, so the same files have to be parsed every time
        which may be time consuming. By adding object serialization or
        similar this might be faster. <ref bug="6960" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Add error recovery for missing imports</title>
        <text>Currently Mibble reports errors and fails loading of MIB
        files containing symbols that have not been properly imported.
        This particular error is often easy to recover from, as in
        most cases the symbol is available from one of the MIB files
        already imported. <ref bug="7113" /></text>
