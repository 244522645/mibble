      <item>
        <title>Added graphical MIB browser</title>
        <text>A graphical MIB browser has been added that allows for
        easy viewing of a MIB contents, while also sending SNMP
        requests for objects. Many thanks to Watsh Rajneesh and HP
        India for contributing the code. Thanks also to Charles F.
        Schatz for providing an alternate implementation.

      <item>
        <title>Added shell scripts for launching utilities</title>
        <text>Shell scripts for Unix and Windows have been added
        for launching the Mibble utility programs. The original
        scripts were contributed by Watsh Rajneesh.

      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added API for loading MIBs from more sources</title>
        <text>Added new <code>addResourceDir()</code> method to the
        MibLoader class, allowing usage of the Java ClassLoader for
        locating and loading MIB files. Also, new
        <code>load(URL)<code> and <code>load(Reader)</code> methods
        has been added to simplify loading MIBs from other sources.
        The MibblePrinter and MibbleValidator programs have also been
        extended to also support URLs. (Bug #7746)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added support for unloading MIBs</title>
        <text>Added new <code>unload()</code> methods to the MibLoader
        class. It is now possible to remove references to a single MIB
        without losing the references to all MIBs. (Bug #7616)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added method for retrieving all OID children</title>
        <text>Added new <code>getAllChildren()</code> method to the
        ObjectIdentifierValue class. This makes it easier to retrieve
        all OID children at once. (Bug #8046)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Modified the API for MibLoader.load() slightly</title>
        <text>The various <code>load()</code> methods in the MibLoader
        class have had their API slightly modified. They are now
        declared to throw IOException instead of the previous
        FileNotFoundException in order to accomodate the new
        <code>load(URL)</code> and <code>load(Reader)</code> methods.
        (Bug #7746)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Fixed issue with not always finding loaded MIBs</title>
        <text>Previously when loading named MIBs, the search path was
        first used to locate the MIB file. If the MIB file couldn't be
        found in the path, an exception is thrown. The MibLoader has
        now been extended to first check the loaded MIB names, thereby
        making it possible to manually load MIB files not adhering to
        the MIB file naming standard. (Bug #6959)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Fixed problem loading MIBs from current directory</title>
        <text>When loading MIB files from the current directory with
        the MibblePrinter or MibbleValidator application, the
        directory wasn't correctly added to the MibLoader path. This
        has now been fixed, so MIB imports now works correctly even
        for file names without a directory portion. (Bug #6528)</text>

    <h1>Version 2.2 (2003-11-03):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Added support for ASN1.1 type tags</title>
        <text>All primitive type now have default ASN.1 type tags and
        these may also be overridden by tags in the MIB files. New
        methods <code>isPrimitive()</code> and <code>getTag()</code>
        has been added to <code>MibType</code>. Thanks to Sudhir
        Khurana for pointing this out. (Bugs #5001 &amp; 5003)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added validation of sequence elements</title>
        <text>Sequence element names previously weren't validated
        against the containing MIB. This has now been changed so
        that sequence elements inside an OBJECT TYPE will be looked
        up in the MIB. If no symbol with that name could be found,
        a new default symbol is created. Thanks to Charles F. Schatz
        for finding and reporting this. (Bug #5904).</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added access to referenced type and value symbols</title>
        <text>When resolving type and value references, the
        referenced symbol name was previously lost and only the type
        or value information was extracted. This has been fixed and
        new convenience methods <code>isReferenceTo()</code> in the
        MibType and MibValue classes have been added. Thanks to
        Charles F. Schatz for suggesting this. (Bug #6112).</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added a number of missing accessor methods</title>
        <text>Several primitive types lacked accessor methods for
        retrieving the constraints, defined values and similar. The
        MIB symbols lacked a getMib() method. These accessor methods
        have now been added. (Bug #5007).</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed the logging API</title>
        <text>The logging API was simplified by removal of the log
        printing classes. The same functionality is now present
        directly in the <code>MibLoaderLog</code> class. A new method
        <code>entries()</code> allows direct retrieval of all log
        entries from the log, providing a more generic approach than
        the previous one. (Bug #6116)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Improved Javadoc API documentation</title>
        <text>The Javadoc API documentation has been generally
        improved in various places. References to appropriate RFC
        documents have been added along with initial package
        overviews. (Bug #6155)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Updated to version 1.4 of Grammatica</title>
        <text>The Grammatica library distributed with Mibble has been
        updated to version 1.4 (from 1.3). The build file has been
        simplified as a result of this. (Bug #5000)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Removed some previously public methods</title>
        <text>A number of internal methods were previously public
        although there was no need for them to be. This has been
        fixed by making them private or package protected. Code that
        called these methods should be modified to use the correct
        public counterparts.</text>
      </item>
    </list>


    <h1>Version 2.1 (2003-08-22):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Corrected MIB symbol value search</title>
        <text>Searching for MIB symbols by value never returned any
        results in the previous version. Thanks to Nigel Mellor for
        finding and fixing this. (Bug #4893)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Updated to version 1.3 of Grammatica</title>
        <text>The Grammatica library distributed with Mibble has been
        updated to version 1.3 (from 1.2). Minor changes have been
        made to the parser to accomodate this. (Bug #4903)</text>
      </item>
    </list>


    <h1>Version 2.0 (2003-07-19):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Complete rewrite with API and name change</title>
        <text>The project has been renamed to Mibble, and the library
        has been completely rewritten from scratch. The API:s have
        also been replaced to correct a number of serious flaws in
        the previous design.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added complete support for SNMPv2 and SNMPv3</title>
        <text>All types and constructs in SNMPv2 and SNMPv3 are now
        supported.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added a real MIB import mechanism</title>
        <text>Symbol imports are now handled by reading and parsing
        the MIB file. Standard IANA and IETF MIB files have been
        added to the JAR library, in order to always have these
        imports available.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added full access to all type information</title>
        <text>All of the type information can now be easily accessed
        through methods in the type classes.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added syntactical and semantical error recovery</title>
        <text>The MIB parser now attempts to recover from errors in
        the MIB file. All encountered errors are available after the
        parsing is complete. This change was made available by using
        Grammatica instead of JavaCC to generate the parser.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added warnings for wrong identifier case</title>
        <text>A warning is now issued if the first character in a
        type identifier is lower-case, or if the first character in a
        value identifier is upper-case.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added HTML release notes</title>
        <text>The release notes are now generated to both text and
        HTML format from an XML representation.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed parser generator to Grammatica</title>
        <text>The JavaCC parser generator has been replaced with
        Grammatica. This was done as JavaCC isn't free software, and
        Grammatica was chosen as it provides a simple grammar syntax,
        a decent parsing and analysis framework, and very high
        quality error handling.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Removed the old symbol tree model</title>
        <text>The symbol tree model has been removed as it was not
        compatible with the new API:s.</text>
      </item>
    </list>

        <text>Relicensed all the source code to GPL plus a linking
        exception. See the new LICENSE.txt file for details.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Removed JavaCC requirement from Ant build file</title>
        <text>Removed the strict dependency of JavaCC from Ant build
        file (build.xml). The JavaCC parser generator will be replaced
        in a future version of the library.</text>
      </item>
    </list>


    <h1>Version 1.1 (2003-01-06):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Updated MIB syntax to SNMPv2</title>
        <text>The MIB file parser can now handle several new macros,
        such as MODULE-IDENITY, OBJECT-IDENTITY, NOTIFICATION-TYPE,
        OBJECT-GROUP, NOTIFICATION-GROUP, MODULE-COMPLIANCE and the
        improved OBJECT-TYPE macro (as of SNMPv2).</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Updated MIB syntax with textual conventions</title>
        <text>The MIB file parser can now handle the
        TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro type.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>API changes breaking backwards compability</title>
        <text>The MIB class was renamed to Mib and several new
        methods were added to allow easy access to the information
        in the MIB file. Some old methods were also renamed to better
        match the new methods.</text>

      <item>
        <title>Improved API documentation</title>
        <text>The API documentation has been somewhat improved by
        adding package descriptions and improving the class
        comments.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added MIB example code</title>
        <text>An example class has been added to demonstrate how the
