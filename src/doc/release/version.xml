    <h1>Version <param name="version"/> (<param name="date"/>):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Added new convenience methods</title>
        <text>The <code>MibValueSymbol</code> class in the Mibble API
        has been improved by the addition of new methods for
        retrieving child symbols. This will facilitate some accesses
        that could previously be a bit cumbersome to write.

      <item>
        <title>Fixed issue with MIB file not being set in loader log</title>
        <text>The MIB file was sometime set to null in the
        <code>MibLoaderLog</code> entries. This could cause
        NullPointerExceptions when attepting to print an error or
        a warning message. This has been fixed so that NPE:s will no
        longer occur in these cases and the MIB loader should now
        properly set the MIB file in all log entries.

      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Fixed size constraint type validity checking</title>
        <text>The <code>SizeConstraint</code> didn't accept the
        <code>StringType</code> as compatible, which has now been
        fixed. All constraints are now also checked for validity
        upon type initialization. <ref bug="10823" /></text>

    <h1>Version 2.5 (2004-10-26):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Added SNMPv2c &amp; SNMPv3 to the MIB browser</title>
        <text>The MIB browser application has been updated in a
        variety of ways, adding support for SNMPv2c &amp; SNMPv3,
        command-line MIB loading and improved tree walking. The
        graphical interface has also been totally reworked so it
        should now both look better and provide more visual feedback.
        The browser is now also available in the commercial version.

      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added support for multiple MIB modules in a single file</title>
        <text>The library now supports loading multiple MIB modules
        from a single file, as required per the ASN.1 standard. It
        is still strongly recommended to place each MIB module in its
        own file however. Thanks to Frank Fock for reporting this.
        <ref bug="10261" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added new base class for SNMP macro types</title>
        <text>Added a new <code>SnmpType</code> class as a new base
        class for all the SNMP macro types. So far the API it
        provides is rather minimal, but it makes it easier to
        distinguish between ASN.1 types and SNMP macro types. Thanks
        to Thomas Åhlén for suggesting this.
        <ref bug="10731" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added new convenience methods to some classes</title>
        <text>The <code>MibValueSymbol</code>,
        <code>ObjectIdentifierValue</code> and <code>SnmpAccess</code>
        classes in the Mibble API have been improved by the addition
        of new methods. This will facilitate some searches or tests
        that could previously be a bit cumbersome to write.
        <ref bug="10634" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added OID tree printing to MibblePrinter</title>
        <text>The <code>MibblePrinter</code> test application has been
        extended to allow several input files and now also contains an
        option to print the complete OID tree. Thanks to Thomas Åhlén
        for the original idea. <ref bug="10651" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed semantics of getDescription() method</title>
        <text>The <code>getDescription()</code> method has been
        changed to return a cleaner version of the description text.
        All unneeded indentation is removed and tab characters are
        now replaced with spaces. The old semantics is available from
        the new <code>getUnformattedDescription()</code> method.
        <ref bug="10790" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed the location of the bundled MIB files</title>
        <text>The MIB files bundled with Mibble have been moved to
        a separate JAR-file. This makes it easier to replace, update
        or remove them without modifying other parts of Mibble. As a
        result of this, the parser JAR-file has also been renamed.
        <ref bug="10648" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed the bundled MIB file content</title>
        <text>The MIB files bundled with Mibble have been updated.
        Many new IANA and IETF MIB files have been added and quite a
        few existing MIBs have been modified to the corresponding
        latest version. Thanks to Thomas Åhlén for pointing this out.
        <ref bug="10647" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Fixed issue with OIDs not being merged properly</title>
        <text>The OID tree was previously missing child components
        (symbols) in some cases. This could occur when the same OID
        was defined in two MIB files, something commonly used to
        avoid circular imports. Now all the OIDs are properly merged
        to any depth, making sure that none are ignored. Thanks to
        Thomas Åhlén for finding this. <ref bug="9962" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Fixed issue with MIBs being loaded as often as imported</title>
        <text>Previously it was possible that some base MIBs, that
        were used in several places, got loaded several times by the
        <code>MibLoader</code>. This didn't affect the correctness of
        the results, but wasted time and memory. The MibLoader has
        now been corrected to avoid this and therefore loads many MIB
        files faster. <ref bug="10673" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Fixed OID searching in Mib.getSymbolByOid()</title>
        <text>The Mib.getSymbolByOid() method handled OIDs with table
        indices erroneously due to a conceptual error. This has now
        been corrected, but has unfortunately led to a slight API
        change, removing the exactMatch parameter in the method call.
        <ref bug="10765" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Fixed documentation terminology and feature list</title>
        <text>Various pieces of documentation previously used the
        wrong terminology for SMIv1 and SMIv2, which has now been
        corrected. Also, the feature list has been updated to be a
        bit more informative, although documentation will primarily
        be added to the website from now on. Thanks to David T.
        Perkins and Frank Fock for pointing out these shortcomings.

    <h1>Version 2.4 (2004-05-27):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Relicensed to GNU GPL</title>
        <text>Most of the source code has been relicensed to GNU GPL,
        removing the previous linking exception. As an alternative to
        using the GNU GPL license, a non-exclusive commercial license
        for Mibble can be purchased. A FAQ explaining the implications
        of this is available on the Mibble web site.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added simpler OID to symbol lookup</title>
        <text>A new method <code>getSymbolByOid</code> has been added
        to the <code>Mib</code> class to simplify the lookup of
        symbols from OIDs. This method handles table row number inside
        OIDs, that the <code>getSymbolByValue</code> method couldn't
        handle. <ref bug="9117" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed MIB loader to search inside files</title>
        <text>If the <code>MibLoader</code> fails to locate a MIB file
        based on its name, it will now resort to read the first few
        lines from all files in the search path until a matching MIB
        name is found. Opening many files may be a potential
        performance bottleneck, so it is still recommended best
        practice to name MIB files according to the MIB module name.
        <ref bug="8862" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed some symbol import errors to warnings</title>
        <text>Missing imports for symbols where the other symbols are
        imported from the right MIB is no longer an error. A recovery
        mechanism has been added searching for an undefined symbol in
        all imported MIB files, issuing a warning instead of an error
        if the symbol was found. <ref bug="8863" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed to a simpler Ant build file</title>
        <text>The <code>build.xml</code> file for Apache Ant
        distributed with Mibble has been simplified. It now also
        contains some documentation to make it easier to use.
        <ref bug="9097" /></text>
      </item>
    </list>


    <h1>Version 2.3 (2004-03-10):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Added graphical MIB browser</title>
        <text>A graphical MIB browser has been added that allows for
        easy viewing of a MIB contents, while also sending SNMP
        requests for objects. Many thanks to Watsh Rajneesh and HP
        India for contributing the code. Thanks also to Charles F.
        Schatz for providing an alternate implementation.
        <ref bug="4366" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added shell scripts for launching utilities</title>
        <text>Shell scripts for Unix and Windows have been added
        for launching the Mibble utility programs. The original
        scripts were contributed by Watsh Rajneesh.
        <ref bug="6961" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added API for loading MIBs from more sources</title>
        <text>Added new <code>addResourceDir()</code> method to the
        MibLoader class, allowing usage of the Java ClassLoader for
        locating and loading MIB files. Also, new
        <code>load(URL)</code> and <code>load(Reader)</code> methods
        has been added to simplify loading MIBs from other sources.
        The MibblePrinter and MibbleValidator programs have also been
        extended to also support URLs. Thanks to Yun Freund for
        suggesting this. <ref bug="7746" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added support for unloading MIBs</title>
        <text>Added new <code>unload()</code> methods to the MibLoader
        class. It is now possible to remove references to a single MIB
        without losing the references to all MIBs.
        <ref bug="7616" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added method for retrieving all OID children</title>
        <text>Added new <code>getAllChildren()</code> method to the
        ObjectIdentifierValue class. This makes it easier to retrieve
        all OID children at once. <ref bug="8046" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Modified the API for MibLoader.load() slightly</title>
        <text>The various <code>load()</code> methods in the MibLoader
        class have had their API slightly modified. They are now
        declared to throw IOException instead of the previous
        FileNotFoundException in order to accomodate the new
        <code>load(URL)</code> and <code>load(Reader)</code> methods.
        <ref bug="7746" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Modified OID child ordering</title>
        <text>The ObjectIdentifierValue child ordering has been
        changed from undefined to numerical order. The new
        implementation is actually faster than the previous one, due
        to more clever object comparison than previously used. 
        <ref bug="8090" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Fixed issue with not always finding loaded MIBs</title>
        <text>Previously when loading named MIBs, the search path was
        first used to locate the MIB file. If the MIB file couldn't be
        found in the path, an exception is thrown. The MibLoader has
        now been extended to first check the loaded MIB names, thereby
        making it possible to manually load MIB files not adhering to
        the MIB file naming standard. Thanks to Zemian Deng for
        pointing this out. <ref bug="6959" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Fixed problem loading MIBs from current directory</title>
        <text>When loading MIB files from the current directory with
        the MibblePrinter or MibbleValidator application, the
        directory wasn't correctly added to the MibLoader path. This
        has now been fixed, so MIB imports now works correctly even
        for file names without a directory portion. 
        <ref bug="6528" /></text>

    <h1>Version 2.2 (2003-11-03):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Added support for ASN1.1 type tags</title>
        <text>All primitive type now have default ASN.1 type tags and
        these may also be overridden by tags in the MIB files. New
        methods <code>isPrimitive()</code> and <code>getTag()</code>
        has been added to <code>MibType</code>. Thanks to Sudhir
        Khurana for pointing this out. <ref bug="5001" /> &amp; 
        <ref bug="5003" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added validation of sequence elements</title>
        <text>Sequence element names previously weren't validated
        against the containing MIB. This has now been changed so
        that sequence elements inside an OBJECT TYPE will be looked
        up in the MIB. If no symbol with that name could be found,
        a new default symbol is created. Thanks to Charles F. Schatz
        for finding and reporting this. <ref bug="5904" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added access to referenced type and value symbols</title>
        <text>When resolving type and value references, the
        referenced symbol name was previously lost and only the type
        or value information was extracted. This has been fixed and
        new convenience methods <code>isReferenceTo()</code> in the
        MibType and MibValue classes have been added. Thanks to
        Charles F. Schatz for suggesting this.
        <ref bug="6112" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added a number of missing accessor methods</title>
        <text>Several primitive types lacked accessor methods for
        retrieving the constraints, defined values and similar. The
        MIB symbols lacked a getMib() method. These accessor methods
        have now been added. <ref bug="5007" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed the logging API</title>
        <text>The logging API was simplified by removal of the log
        printing classes. The same functionality is now present
        directly in the <code>MibLoaderLog</code> class. A new method
        <code>entries()</code> allows direct retrieval of all log
        entries from the log, providing a more generic approach than
        the previous one. <ref bug="6116" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Improved Javadoc API documentation</title>
        <text>The Javadoc API documentation has been generally
        improved in various places. References to appropriate RFC
        documents have been added along with initial package
        overviews. <ref bug="6155" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Updated to version 1.4 of Grammatica</title>
        <text>The Grammatica library distributed with Mibble has been
        updated to version 1.4 (from 1.3). The build file has been
        simplified as a result of this. <ref bug="5000" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Removed some previously public methods</title>
        <text>A number of internal methods were previously public
        although there was no need for them to be. This has been
        fixed by making them private or package protected. Code that
        called these methods should be modified to use the correct
        public counterparts.</text>

    <h1>Version 2.1 (2003-08-22):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Corrected MIB symbol value search</title>
        <text>Searching for MIB symbols by value never returned any
        results in the previous version. Thanks to Nigel Mellor for
        finding and fixing this. <ref bug="4893" /></text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Updated to version 1.3 of Grammatica</title>
        <text>The Grammatica library distributed with Mibble has been
        updated to version 1.3 (from 1.2). Minor changes have been
        made to the parser to accomodate this.

    <h1>Version 2.0 (2003-07-19):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Complete rewrite with API and name change</title>
        <text>The project has been renamed to Mibble, and the library
        has been completely rewritten from scratch. The API:s have
        also been replaced to correct a number of serious flaws in
        the previous design.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added complete support for SNMPv2 and SNMPv3</title>
        <text>All types and constructs in SNMPv2 and SNMPv3 are now
        supported.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added a real MIB import mechanism</title>
        <text>Symbol imports are now handled by reading and parsing
        the MIB file. Standard IANA and IETF MIB files have been
        added to the JAR library, in order to always have these
        imports available.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added full access to all type information</title>
        <text>All of the type information can now be easily accessed
        through methods in the type classes.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added syntactical and semantical error recovery</title>
        <text>The MIB parser now attempts to recover from errors in
        the MIB file. All encountered errors are available after the
        parsing is complete. This change was made available by using
        Grammatica instead of JavaCC to generate the parser.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added warnings for wrong identifier case</title>
        <text>A warning is now issued if the first character in a
        type identifier is lower-case, or if the first character in a
        value identifier is upper-case.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Added HTML release notes</title>
        <text>The release notes are now generated to both text and
        HTML format from an XML representation.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Changed parser generator to Grammatica</title>
        <text>The JavaCC parser generator has been replaced with
        Grammatica. This was done as JavaCC isn't free software, and
        Grammatica was chosen as it provides a simple grammar syntax,
        a decent parsing and analysis framework, and very high
        quality error handling.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Removed the old symbol tree model</title>
        <text>The symbol tree model has been removed as it was not
        compatible with the new API:s.</text>

      <item>
        <title>Relicensing to GPL + linking exception</title>
        <text>Relicensed all the source code to GPL plus a linking
        exception. See the new LICENSE.txt file for details.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Removed JavaCC requirement from Ant build file</title>
        <text>Removed the strict dependency of JavaCC from Ant build
        file (build.xml). The JavaCC parser generator will be replaced
        in a future version of the library.</text>

    <h1>Version 1.1 (2003-01-06):</h1>

    <list>
      <item>
        <title>Updated MIB syntax to SNMPv2</title>
        <text>The MIB file parser can now handle several new macros,
        such as MODULE-IDENITY, OBJECT-IDENTITY, NOTIFICATION-TYPE,
        OBJECT-GROUP, NOTIFICATION-GROUP, MODULE-COMPLIANCE and the
        improved OBJECT-TYPE macro (as of SNMPv2).</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Updated MIB syntax with textual conventions</title>
        <text>The MIB file parser can now handle the
        TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro type.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>API changes breaking backwards compability</title>
        <text>The MIB class was renamed to Mib and several new
        methods were added to allow easy access to the information
        in the MIB file. Some old methods were also renamed to better
        match the new methods.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Improved code style</title>
        <text>All the source code has been reindented to use four (4)
        spaces, and various minor code style improvements have been
        made in the source tree.</text>
      </item>
